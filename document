Since there was nothing new to merge, from test-task branch to main branch. 
I am creating a new file, which is this one, and i am creating this file in test-task branch. See above.
I will name this file as document, and then i will go to the pull requests tab here above and then create a new PR from this current branch (test-task) to main.
See how it works.
